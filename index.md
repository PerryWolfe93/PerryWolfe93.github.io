## I build Android applications

I currently study computer science at Southern New Hampshire University. During my time in the program, I have learned about many of the different aspects that encompass computer science. The exposure to many different subjects was very helpful for me in determining which areas I am interested in and which I am not. If not for a previous course at SNHU I would not have realized my interest in designing applications.  The combination of both front and back-end development is an enticing challenge for me.  I hope to pursue a career in full-stack development because I will be involved in every step of projects I complete. Working on my project has shown me the value and satisfaction to be found in using programming to turn an idea or interest into a final product.
Developing the content for my ePorfolio has showcased my strengths as I have built an Android application using the Java programming language.  I developed a fitness application that allows users to store and track different fitness information such as weight, calorie intake, macros, and more. The data is stored in SQLite. In the future, I would like to add functionality to enable the user to store data in an online data server as well. To ensure data security, users are given only the necessary permissions to complete their tasks. My fitness app is not particularly collaborative among users, but if a user was given too much permission it could have very bad outcomes. A user might find their diligently tracked data deleted or stolen. My application makes use of a sorting algorithm to sort user data into alphabetical lists, providing them an easy way to get previously stored information.

The courses I have taken at SNHU have also allowed me to learn about both collaborating with team members and communicating with stakeholders. For instance, in one course, my class collaborated using a version control system to share project updates. Without version control, large projects with shared workloads between multiple people would be impossible because changes could possibly be unrecognizable from other versions before they are even ready to be shared. Agile is a project management method used to integrate stakeholders with developers throughout the software development lifecycle instead of at the beginning and end.  This increases the likelihood that the investors will receive a finished product that does what they expect. I am certain knowledge of version control and Agile method will be invaluable in my future workplace to facilitate collaboration with my peers.
