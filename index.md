#### Perry Wolfe's SNHU Capstone Project

This ePortfolio displays project enhancements built for the Computer Science Capstone course at Southern New Hampshire University. The purpose of the project was to refine a previously created artifact or artifacts to showcase improvements in software design/development, data structures and algorithms, and databases.

##### Self-Assessment

During my time studying at SNHU I have learned lots about the field of computer science.  In developing the enhancements for my capstone project, I am certain that one of my biggest strengths can also be a crippling weakness.  As someone who knows exactly how they want something to look and function, it is very discouraging when hours have been lost trying to solve a problem that may or may not be important the the overall project.  However, this trait can also be used as a strength since lots of learning happens when solving these problems.  

My capstone project is an Android application built using the Java programming language in Android Studio.  The project began as a very simple application from a previous course.  Once I began enhancing the project for this course, I quickly became aware just how much material there was to learn.  At first this was overwhelming, but after some time, I learned that if I understood the programming language and structure, all of the functions provided by Java, Android Studio, and the necessary additional libraries were very similar.  During my time working on this project I have improved tremendously in my skill as a software developer, though I am very aware of how far I still have to go.

I have linked my project to Git for version control and Github for team collaboration.  Although I am working on this project alone, understanding how to push, pull, merge, and branch in Github will be very useful in the future.  As a team member, I believe I would be a great asset.  I am very open-minded when it comes to listening to the ideas of others.  Even when I feel that I have a clear understanding of something, I can acknowledge that someone else may still have valuable input.  When working as a team, it is important to utilize all assets to achieve the goal.

Communication is an area that I am lacking in.  For example, this project required progress updates throught the course of the semester, which I was unable to give.  When communicating to an employer or stakeholder, this would be unacceptable.  Going forward I hope to improve on this skill by ensuring I do not fall behind early.  One aspect of communcation that may be seen as either a strength or a weakness is my ability to relay only information that I know to be true.  An employer could always rely on me to get an accurate assesment of how a project is developing.

The enhancement areas of this project are software design/development, data structures and algorithms, and databases.  The project has facilitated learning in each of these three categories tremendously.  The overhaul of the user interface was the focus of the first enhancement (software design/development).  Although it is within the Android Studio development environment, I am now very comfortable working with widgets and design layouts, though there are still some areas that I see I can improve upon.  For the second enhancement, I planned to build functionality to allow my application to sync data from its local SQLite database with data from a remote MS SQL Server database.  Completion of the enhancement has proven more difficult than expected due to a database restructuring that has broken parts of the application.  Once these bugs are worked out however, I am certain that I will be able to complete the planned enhancement.  Finally, the databases enhancement required me to build functionality for a user to run the application as either a local or remote user.
