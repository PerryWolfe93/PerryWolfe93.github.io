#### Perry's ePortfolio

This ePortfolio displays project enhancements built for the Computer Science Capstone course at Southern New Hampshire University. The purpose of the project was to refine a previously created artifact to showcase improvements in software design/development, data structures and algorithms, and database methods.

##### Self-Assessment

With the time I have spent in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University I have been introduced to many aspects of the field of Computer Science.  Some of these include object-oriented programming, programming embedded devices, collaborating with others using Git and Github version control systems, data analytics, and SQL.  My first few courses at SNHU served as an introduction to programming with Python and Java.  A basic understanding of these object-oriented languages served as building blocks for all of my future projects.  I learned to work in a team while learning Git and Github by pulling code from and pushing code to an online Github repository on a music playlist application.  While there is lots more to learn about working with a team, this provided a great introduction.  I also learned to use SQL in a database course which taught nearly all SQL commands as well as database design considerations and permissions.

For my capstone project, I have chosen to improve a fitness application built in Android Studio using Java.  The project initially started as a very simple application built for the Mobile Architecture and Programming course at SNHU.  This artifact displays an understanding of Java, user interface design, SQL database methods and design, communicating data across the internet, and PHP.  The application is designed to allow a user to store their weights, exercises, diets, and journals.  The collected data is used in an algorithm to provide the user with recommendations based on their goals.  The user can save their data either locally using SQLite or remotely using a MySQL database stored in a cloud server.

Enhancements in three categories were required for this assignment.  The first of these is software design, for which I have implemented functionality for a user to save data in a fitness journal.  This data will eventually be used in the applications recommendation algorithm.  For the second enhancement in the data structures and algorithms category, I have implemented a binary search.  This binary search algorithm is used when searching for a food within a food catalog to add to the current day's diet.  I have also added indexes to the SQLite database to make data retrieval faster.  For my final enhancement in the databases category, I have reconfigured the login and authentication method to be more secure.  I have implemented token authentication as well as a user role for application users.
