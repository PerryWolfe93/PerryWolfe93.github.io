#### Software Design Enhancement

With this enhancement, I have overhauled the user interface of my Fitness Tracker application created in Android Studio for the previous course, Mobile Architecture and Programming.  This enhancement demonstrates knowledge of front-end development.  The Android Studio development environment provides tools for altering .xml files to create the layouts used by mobile Android applications.  While there is a simplicity to this kind of programming, it can get very chaotic when working with dozens of widgets.  Having good organizational practices such as appropriate spacing and naming convention is extremely helpful when building an interface. 

When beginning this enhancement, I quickly realized that I needed to do some research on organizational methods when designing layouts in Android Studio.  Once I found a method that I liked, I used it to keep all of the text, user entry fields, switches, radio groups, seek bars, and buttons in place.  The method that I found should allow for the interface to still look fine across multiple platforms as each widget's location is constrained relative to one another.  

Another part of the enhancement was adding a moving graphic in the background.  I tried to choose something that might fit a fitness app, so I chose a blue/light blue gradient.  In performing this modification, I gained a better understanding of how file systems are organized in Android Studio.  I also added in some .png graphic files to give some more life to the login screen.  I plan on adding more to the other layout activities as well after the course is over.

Each of the six main layout activities within the application now have a more structured layout and a more visually interesting aesthetic.
